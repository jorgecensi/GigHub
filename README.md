#-GigHub is a mini social network that makes it really easy for live music lovers to track the gigs of their favorite artists. #-Artists can sign up and list their gigs. When adding a gig, they should specify the date/time, location and genre of the gig. #-An artist should have a page called My Upcoming Gigs. From there, they should be able to edit or remove an existing gig, or add another gig to the list. #-Users should be able to view all upcoming gigs or search them by artist, genre or location. They should be able to view details of a gig and add it to their calendar #-Additionally, users should be able to follow their favorite artists. When they follow an artist, they should see the upcoming gigs of their favorite artists in the Gig Feed.
